    >* I.Project title (5 points)
       Number of BLM-related arrests in Chicago by ZIP code

    >* II.Data source used in the map
       1. Arrest data downloaded from the Chicago Data Portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Arrests/dpt3-jri9 Links to an external site.)
       2. Arrests on specific charge(8-4-010-(F): Disorderly Conduct – Assembly > 3Persons/Breach of Peach charge) are collected manually. This data doesn’t have arrest location information. So, I identified the location of each “Disorderly Conduct” arrest by utilizing the Chicago Police Department Arrest Record Search (http://publicsearch1.chicagopolice.org/ Links to an external site.). Finally, I merged the location into the arrest dataset based on CB number. I will share my final version of dataset(including address location) with our instructor, John.

    >* III.Motivations for drawing this map
       I am now preparing a paper studying the relationship between Chicago citizens exposed to violent protests(or BLM-related arrests) and their demand for police spending. I think this map can show what parts(i.e., ZIP code) of Chicago were more exposed to such protests.
